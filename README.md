DPClusSBO: An integrated software for clustering of simple and bipartite graphs.

Network analysis particularly graph clustering has become a useful and important
technique in data mining applications. It provides a global view of data structure where
densely connected objects are grouped based on their common properties. Over the
past decade, various simple graph clustering and biclustering techniques have been
widely used but the implementation of those algorithms remains limited. In this work,
we present a new integrated software implementing the DPClusO and BiClusO
algorithms using Java to be utilized for simple and bipartite graph clustering. Our aim is
to provide an open-source tool with lots of user-friendly options to delve into network
data. This tool will provide the user with GUI based facilities for simple and bipartite
graph clustering along with filtering and amalgamation of clusters, hierarchical node
analysis, node distribution among cluster set and visualization of all or partial portion of
a big cluster set. We name this tool DPClusSBO because this can be used to perform
Density Periphery based Clustering of Simple and Bipartite graphs with Overlapping
property
